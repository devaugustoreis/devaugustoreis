- 👋 Hi, My name is Augusto Reis and I'm 27 years old! I used to work as an animator, but now I'm a junior developer!
- 💞️ I discovered that I really liked programming and now I'm totally dedicated to that! I'm a fast learner and I love solving problems! I also love games!
- 🌱 I’m currently working with Spring Boot (Java) and Angular (Javascript/Typescript). I also wish to learn many other languages, frameworks and technologies (React, Docker, C#, C++, Node.js, etc)! I have interest in both front-end and back-end areas!
- 📫 Contact me at 'devaugustoreis@gmail.com' or 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/augusto-victor-reis/'.
