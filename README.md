- 👋 Hi, My name is Augusto Reis and I'm 26 years old! I used to work as an animator, but now I'm a beginner developer!
- 💞️ I discovered that I really liked programming and now I'm totally dedicated to that! I'm a fast learner and I love solving problems! I also love games!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Django, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Database (SQLite). I also wish to learn many other languages and frameworks (C#, Java, C++, Node.js, etc)! I have a big interest in the back-end area!
- 📫 Contact me at 'devaugustoreis@gmail.com' or 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/augusto-victor-reis/'.
